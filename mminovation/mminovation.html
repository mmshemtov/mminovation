              <h2>What Is This About?</h2>
              <p>I really need to create a website to use my skills
                  and not lose them as has been happening in the last while
                  beacause i'm not practicing it so I'm forgetting it all.
              </p>
              <p>Since I was a kid I'm always coming up with ideas and 
                  I'm sure if I would have written even just some down I'd be 
                  doing well. On this website I will try to figure out an easy 
                  way to log my ideas and save them. And who knows maybe one day
                  I'll look back and say "Wow! I was a genius!" or I might come
                  to the opposite conclusion. Wish me luck!
                  "good luck..."

               <p>This was a basic java course learning everything 
                   between building a basic java sheet and making varisbles,
                   to writing for loops and functions. It also 
                   taught me how to write arrays and 2d arrays.
                   It was a 25 hour course which i think takes a little 
                   shorter to complete. I've forgotten most of it but I don't 
                   think it would take me long to freshen my skills.

                <p>This course teaches you the necessary html, css, and
                   javascript to make a responsive website with nice design 
                   and some features. It's a different style than
                   codecademy was since this is a bunch of videos with 
                   someone showing you step by step what to do, vs codecademy 
                   you actually had to do each step on your own. It's a 
                   56 hour course though it took a while for me to complete it and I still have to review a lot of it.

               <p>I hope to implemnt the tools that I learnt in the treehouse course by 
                 building this small website. My goal is to be able to use bootstrap to build this website using:

                with me anytime this past year for any lnger than 20 min 
                there's no chance that I would'nt mention Gamestop. It all 
                started a year ago whe I lost money on amc and when GME jumped
                up in Feb I decided to go in only to go all in a few days later
                  ever since I've just been adding and adding. I became so 
                  into it I think it had even a small part in how my time went 
                  in Pretoria. I was so into it that I didn't know how to speak
                  about anything else. 5-6 months ago I could easily talk for an hour straight
                  and still have alot to say about it. I also knew what I was 
                  talking about, mostly atleast. Anyhow, I'm still all in and wish there 
                  was a way for me to get more shares.

                     The day when Ryan Cohen bought into the Gamestop. He baught 9 million shares worth at 
                       an average price of $8.43 totalling 76 million dollars. GameStop traded at $6.59, up 54% for the day afeter the news came out. 
                       Ryan Cohen buying into the company was a reversal for the stock. The fact that he had such a large ownership
                        meant that he can - and because of the person he is, will- take the company from a dying brick and mortar company to a 
                        giant E-commerce business as he did with chewy and as he stated that he wants to do with gamestop.
